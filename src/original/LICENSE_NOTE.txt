TIMELINE:

  2013        - DVOACAP created by Alex Shovkoplyas under MPL 1.1
  May 2025    - DVOACAP relicensed to MIT by Alex Shovkoplyas
  Nov 2025    - dvoacap-python Python port created under MIT

Since dvoacap-python was created AFTER the relicensing to MIT, the use
of MIT License for the Python port is legally sound.
