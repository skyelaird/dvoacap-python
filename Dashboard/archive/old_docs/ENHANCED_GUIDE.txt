UNDERSTANDING THE ENHANCED DISPLAY
===================================

MAP FEATURES:
-------------
🏠 RED MARKER = Your QTH (VE1ATM at FN74ui)
🟢 GREEN CIRCLES = Good propagation (>60% reliability)
🟡 YELLOW CIRCLES = Fair propagation (30-60%)
🔴 RED CIRCLES = Poor propagation (<30%)
--- DASHED LINES = Great circle paths to each region
🌅 YELLOW SHADING = Gray line zone (best DX area)

Region Codes Explained:
- EU = Europe (general)
- UK = United Kingdom
- JA = Japan
- VK = Australia
- ZL = New Zealand  
- AF = Africa (general)
- SA = South America
- CA = Central America
- AS = Asia (general)
- OC = Oceania (Pacific Islands)

BAND CARD DETAILS:
------------------
40m (7.1 MHz)
  MUF: 11.2 MHz        ← Maximum frequency that will refract back
  Best: 9.5 MHz        ← Optimal operating frequency (85% of MUF)
  Evening              ← Peak propagation time
  
  • CA  S8             ← Central America, Signal strength S8
  • EU  S7             ← Europe, Signal strength S7

Reading S-Meter Values:
- S9+40dB = Extremely strong (SNR > 45dB)
- S9+20dB = Very strong (SNR 25-35dB)
- S9      = Strong (SNR 10-15dB)
- S7-S8   = Good signals (SNR 0-10dB)
- S5-S6   = Weak but readable (SNR -10 to 0dB)
- S3-S4   = Very weak (SNR -20 to -10dB)
- <S1     = Barely detectable (SNR < -38dB)

SOLAR CONDITIONS PANEL:
-----------------------
Solar Flux (139.68):
  High (>150)     = Excellent HF conditions, high bands open
  Moderate (100-150) = Good conditions
  Low (<100)      = Poor high band propagation

Kp Index (2):
  0-2 (Quiet)     = Excellent propagation
  3-4 (Unsettled) = Some degradation
  5+ (Disturbed)  = Poor HF, possible aurora

A Index (30):
  0-20 (Excellent) = Minimal absorption
  20-50 (Good)     = Some absorption
  50+ (Poor)       = Heavy absorption

CONDITIONS: Overall summary (Good/Fair/Poor)

72-HOUR TIMELINE:
-----------------
▶ 20:00 UTC  ← Current hour (highlighted)
  40m: CA, EU, JA
  30m: VK, AF, SA
  
22:00 UTC
  40m: EU, JA
  20m: ZL

Nov 11 02:00Z  ← Next day forecast
  40m: JA, AS
  30m: VK, OC

DXCC ALERTS:
------------
When the red bar appears at top:
🎯 NEEDED DXCC ENTITIES - CURRENTLY WORKABLE!
  Afghanistan • 20m to AS • 65%
  Antarctica • 30m to OC • 58%

This means these needed entities have good propagation RIGHT NOW!

USING THE ENHANCED DASHBOARD
=============================

QUICK START:
1. Run: python generate_propagation.py
2. Start server: python -m http.server 8000
3. Open: http://localhost:8000/propagation_dashboard_enhanced.html
4. Watch for DXCC alerts!

OPERATING WORKFLOW:
1. Check SOLAR CONDITIONS - Are conditions good overall?
2. Check DXCC ALERTS - Any rare DX currently workable?
3. Check BAND CARDS - Which bands are open to regions you need?
4. Check TIMELINE - When will conditions improve?
5. Check MAP - Verify gray line propagation paths
6. Go operate!

ADVANCED TIPS:
--------------

GRAY LINE HUNTING:
- Gray line is the transition zone between day/night
- Shown as yellow shaded area on map
- BEST times are when target is in gray line
- OR when YOU are in gray line
- Morning gray line: 30 min before to 30 min after sunrise
- Evening gray line: 30 min before to 30 min after sunset
- Long-path signals often peak at gray line

MUF OPTIMIZATION:
- Don't operate AT the MUF - band will be unstable
- Best frequency = 85% of MUF (shown as "Best: X MHz")
- If MUF is 14.5 MHz, operate around 12.3 MHz
- Higher in band = fewer hops = stronger signal (if below MUF)

S-METER INTERPRETATION:
- S7+ = Good for SSB
- S5+ = Good for CW/Digital
- S3-S4 = CW/Digital only, difficult
- FT8 can work down to S1 or less!

RELIABILITY PERCENTAGE:
- >70% = Excellent, high probability of QSO
- 50-70% = Good, should be workable
- 30-50% = Marginal, try CW or digital
- <30% = Poor, long shots only

MULTI-DAY PLANNING:
- Check 72-hour forecast before contests
- Plan operating schedule around peak times
- Watch for solar changes (Kp index rising)
- Gray line windows repeat daily ±4 minutes

SOLAR EVENT RESPONSES:
- Kp >5 = Work lower bands (40m/30m better than 20m+)
- Low SFI = Focus on 40m/30m, higher bands may be dead
- After solar flare = Wait 1-2 days, check Kp/A index
- CME impact = Aurora possible, try 6m if aurora visible
