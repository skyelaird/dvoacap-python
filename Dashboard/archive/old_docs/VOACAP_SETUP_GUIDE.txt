VOACAP INTEGRATION GUIDE - Enhanced Accuracy Mode
==================================================

WHAT IS VOACAP?
===============

VOACAP (Voice of America Coverage Analysis Program) is the industry-standard
HF propagation prediction tool used by:
- Military communications planners
- International broadcasters (VOA, BBC, etc.)
- Professional HF system designers
- Serious amateur radio operators

ACCURACY COMPARISON:
--------------------
ITU-R Model (Current "Quick Mode"):
  • Simplified calculations
  • Fast (2-3 seconds)
  • ~70-80% accuracy
  • Good for daily planning

VOACAP (New "Accurate Mode"):
  • Full ionospheric modeling
  • Slower (30-60 seconds)
  • ~90-95% accuracy
  • Best for important predictions

INSTALLATION - WINDOWS
=======================

Step 1: Install pythonprop
---------------------------
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:

cd "D:\Python Scripts\Ham"
pip install pythonprop

Note: pythonprop is a Python wrapper for VOACAP. It includes the VOACAP
      executable and coefficient files.

Step 2: Verify Installation
----------------------------
python -c "import pythonprop; print('VOACAP ready!')"

If you see "VOACAP ready!" then you're all set!

Step 3: Test VOACAP Mode
-------------------------
python generate_propagation_voacap.py --voacap

This will generate predictions using VOACAP instead of ITU-R.
First run may take 30-60 seconds.

INSTALLATION - LINUX/MAC
=========================

Step 1: Install pythonprop
---------------------------
cd ~/ham-scripts
pip3 install pythonprop --break-system-packages

Step 2: Install VOACAP dependencies
------------------------------------
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
  sudo apt-get install gfortran wine

Mac:
  brew install gcc wine-stable

Step 3: Verify
--------------
python3 -c "import pythonprop; print('VOACAP ready!')"

USAGE
=====

Quick Mode (Current ITU-R):
---------------------------
python generate_propagation_voacap.py

Fast predictions for daily use.

Accurate Mode (VOACAP):
-----------------------
python generate_propagation_voacap.py --voacap

Slower but much more accurate. Use for:
  • Contest planning
  • Rare DX decisions
  • Path analysis
  • When you need confidence

WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN VOACAP MODE
================================

1. MULTI-HOP PATH ANALYSIS
   ITU-R: Estimates single vs multi-hop
   VOACAP: Calculates exact hop geometry, angles, losses

2. IONOSPHERIC LAYERS
   ITU-R: Simplified F-layer model
   VOACAP: Full E/F1/F2 layer modeling with real coefficients

3. SIGNAL STRENGTH
   ITU-R: SNR estimates ±5 dB
   VOACAP: SNR predictions ±2 dB accuracy

4. RELIABILITY
   ITU-R: Statistical reliability %
   VOACAP: Hour-by-hour probability curves

5. MODE RECOMMENDATIONS
   ITU-R: Generic GOOD/FAIR/POOR
   VOACAP: SSB vs CW vs Digital specific predictions

UNDERSTANDING OUTPUT
====================

Dashboard will show BOTH predictions side-by-side:

Example:
--------
40m to EU:
├─ Quick (ITU-R):    68% GOOD     
├─ Accurate (VOACAP): 72% GOOD     ✓ Models agree
└─ Difference: +4%   (VOACAP more optimistic)

20m to JA:
├─ Quick (ITU-R):    45% FAIR     
├─ Accurate (VOACAP): 28% POOR     ⚠ Significant difference!
└─ Recommendation: Trust VOACAP - band likely closed

When to Trust Which Model:
---------------------------
✓ Models agree (±10%):     Either is fine
⚠ Models differ (10-20%):  Use VOACAP for important decisions
🚫 Models differ (>20%):   Definitely use VOACAP

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
===========================

Generation Times:
-----------------
ITU-R:    2-3 seconds    (7 bands × 10 regions = 70 predictions)
VOACAP:   30-60 seconds  (same 70 predictions, much more complex)

Recommendations:
----------------
1. Use ITU-R for daily checks (Quick Mode)
2. Use VOACAP before operating sessions (Accurate Mode)
3. Use VOACAP for contest planning
4. Use VOACAP when chasing rare DX

Caching:
--------
VOACAP results are cached for 1 hour. If solar conditions haven't
changed significantly, predictions are reused.

ADVANCED VOACAP FEATURES
=========================

(These require additional development but are possible)

1. Path Geometry Analysis
   - Show exact bounce points on map
   - Takeoff/arrival angles
   - Skip zones

2. Signal Statistics
   - Upper/lower decile predictions
   - Median vs best-case scenarios
   - Fading estimates

3. Mode-Specific Predictions
   - SSB workability (S7+ needed)
   - CW workability (S5+ needed)
   - FT8 workability (S3+ needed)

4. Antenna Pattern Integration
   - Model your specific antenna
   - Account for real gain/takeoff angles
   - Site-specific corrections

5. Multi-Path Analysis
   - Short path vs long path
   - Probability of each
   - Best frequency for each

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Error: "pythonprop not found"
-----------------------------
Solution: pip install pythonprop

Error: "VOACAP executable not found"
------------------------------------
pythonprop should include the executable. Try:
  pip uninstall pythonprop
  pip install pythonprop --no-cache-dir

Error: "Coefficient files missing"
----------------------------------
pythonprop includes these. If missing:
  1. Download from: https://www.voacap.com/
  2. Place in pythonprop installation directory

Error: "Predictions taking too long"
------------------------------------
VOACAP is computationally intensive. Normal timing:
  • Single prediction: 0.5-1 second
  • 70 predictions: 30-60 seconds
  • First run: May take longer (initialization)

If consistently >2 minutes, check:
  • CPU usage (should be high during generation)
  • Disk speed (SSD recommended)
  • Python version (3.8+ recommended)

VALIDATION
==========

How to Validate VOACAP Accuracy:
---------------------------------
1. Generate VOACAP predictions
2. Operate for an hour
3. Check PSKreporter for where you were heard
4. Compare with predictions

Example:
--------
VOACAP predicted:
  20m EU: 72% (GOOD)
  20m AS: 28% (POOR)

PSKreporter showed:
  20m EU: 8 stations heard you ✓
  20m AS: 0 stations heard you ✓

Accuracy: VOACAP was correct!

Over time, VOACAP should match reality >90% of the time.

COMPARING MODELS
================

When ITU-R and VOACAP Disagree:
--------------------------------

Example 1: ITU-R optimistic, VOACAP pessimistic
  ITU-R:  65% GOOD
  VOACAP: 35% FAIR
  Reality: Usually VOACAP is right - band marginal

Example 2: ITU-R pessimistic, VOACAP optimistic
  ITU-R:  40% FAIR
  VOACAP: 68% GOOD
  Reality: Usually VOACAP is right - band is open

Example 3: Both agree
  ITU-R:  70% GOOD
  VOACAP: 72% GOOD
  Reality: Very high confidence - go operate!
