CURRENT STATUS
==============

✓ Initial predictions generated with typical solar conditions
  (SFI: 150, SSN: 100, Kp: 2.0)

✓ Your QSO log analyzed:
  - 1,377 QSOs processed
  - 122 DXCC entities worked
  - 94 LoTW confirmations
  
✓ Dashboard configured for your station:
  - Location: FN74ui (Lunenburg, NS)
  - Antenna: DX Commander 7m Vertical
  - Bands: 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m

SAMPLE CURRENT CONDITIONS
==========================

Based on initial generation (typical mid-cycle conditions):

40m (7.1 MHz):
  ✓ Fair to Europe, UK, Japan, Africa, South America
  
30m (10.125 MHz):
  ✓ Good to Europe, UK, Africa, South America
  ✓ Fair to Japan, Australia, Asia
  
20m (14.15 MHz):
  ✓ Good to New Zealand
  
Higher bands (17m-10m):
  ⚠ Currently closed (typical for nighttime in your timezone)

HOW THE PROPAGATION MODEL WORKS
================================

The system uses sophisticated ITU-R based calculations:

1. MUF Calculation
   - Critical frequency (foF2) from solar flux
   - Path geometry (single vs multi-hop)
   - Distance and bearing to target
   - Time of day (diurnal variation)

2. Signal Quality Assessment
   - Frequency vs MUF ratio (optimal: 85% of MUF)
   - Reliability percentage
   - SNR estimation in dB
   - Absorption factors

3. Geomagnetic Effects
   - Kp index impact on reliability
   - A-index for absorption
   - Aurora warnings

4. Gray Line Enhancement
   - Better propagation at sunrise/sunset
   - Band-specific adjustments

This is MORE sophisticated than "basic" but simplified compared to
full VOACAP. Good enough for practical operating decisions!

DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS
==================

OPTION 1: Local Use (What you have now)
   ✓ No setup needed
   ✓ Open HTML files directly
   ✓ Run Python script when you want updates
   ✓ Perfect for personal use

OPTION 2: Local Web Server
   Run: python3 -m http.server 8000
   Visit: http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ✓ Better for map rendering
   ✓ Easier to refresh

OPTION 3: Static Hosting (Free!)
   Upload to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages
   ✓ Access from anywhere
   ✓ Share with other hams
   ✓ Set up auto-updates with GitHub Actions

OPTION 4: Automated Updates
   Add to crontab:
   0 */2 * * * cd /path/to/predictions && python3 generate_propagation.py
   
   This regenerates predictions every 2 hours automatically

ENHANCEMENT IDEAS
=================

Your system can be enhanced with:

1. Full VOACAP Integration
   - Install pythonprop library
   - Much more accurate predictions
   - Takes longer to compute

2. Real-Time Solar Data
   - Currently falls back to typical values if offline
   - With internet: auto-fetches NOAA data

3. Gray Line Overlay
   - Add terminator visualization to map
   - Show optimal DX times visually

4. DX Cluster Integration
   - Show real-time spots for needed entities
   - Alert when rare DX appears

5. Contest Mode
   - Optimize predictions for specific contests
   - Multi-hop path analysis

6. Historical Analysis
   - Compare predictions vs actual QSOs
   - Improve model accuracy over time
