# Future Functionality Planning

Based on VOACAP manual review - features and capabilities to consider for implementation.

## Priority Features from VOACAP Manual

### 1. Target Selection & DXCC Integration
- [ ] Allow users to select from existing DXCC targets
- [ ] Support specification by:
  - Maidenhead grid locator
  - Georef coordinates
  - Country selection
- [ ] Integration with VOACAP mini planner tool concept

### 2. Greyline Propagation
- [ ] Understand and visualize greyline propagation
- [ ] Terminator visualization and analysis
- [ ] Optimize for greyline DX opportunities

### 3. Antenna Selection & Modeling
- [ ] Comprehensive antenna selection interface
- [ ] Vertical 1/4 wave antenna support
- [ ] DX Commander antenna modeling (or equivalent)
- [ ] Custom antenna pattern support

### 4. Propagation Settings
- [ ] Dynamic propagation settings (currently done?)
- [ ] User-configurable propagation parameters
- [ ] Real-time updates based on conditions

### 5. Visualization Enhancements

#### Propagation Charts
- [ ] Propagation charts as a card/tab in dashboard
- [ ] Interactive propagation visualizations
- [ ] Time-based propagation analysis

#### Reliability Charts
- [ ] Reliability charts as a card/tab
- [ ] Statistical reliability displays
- [ ] Confidence intervals

#### MUF Integration
- [ ] MUF (Most Reliable Mode) visualization
- [ ] Dedicated MUF analysis tab
- [ ] Real-time MUF tracking

### 6. Prime Time Prediction
- [ ] Fundamental objective: Predict prime time for radio communication
- [ ] Tied to target DXCC entity
- [ ] Optimize contact timing recommendations

### 7. Advanced Analysis Tools

#### Propagation Wheel
- [ ] Prop wheel as a tab
- [ ] Propagation Prediction Analysis interface
- [ ] Interactive polar plots

#### REL | SDBW | SNR Analysis
- [ ] Three-in-One Predictions display

- [ ] User preference options

#### Best Frequency Guide
- [ ] Optimal Frequency Selection (friendlier than current)
- [ ] Simplified frequency recommendations
- [ ] Time-optimized frequency suggestions

### 8. Coverage Area Maps
- [ ] Implement coverage area maps (Section 3.1, Page 41 from manual)
- [ ] Smoothing over rastering effect (better than Maidenhead squares)
- [ ] Professional-quality coverage visualization
- [ ] Multiple resolution options

## VOACAP Manual Integration

### Section 2.5 Analysis
- [ ] Review Section 2.5 thoroughly
- [ ] Integrate knowledge derived from analysis
- [ ] Determine how best to present data as information
- [ ] Simplify complex propagation concepts for users

### Mini Planner Functionality
- [ ] User-friendly mini planner
- [ ] Simplified interface for common tasks
- [ ] Quick prediction workflow

## Technical Considerations

### Data Presentation
- Focus on presenting data as actionable information
- Avoid overwhelming users with technical details
- Provide different complexity levels for different user types

### User Interface Philosophy
- Friendlier than traditional VOACAP interface
- Modern, intuitive design
- Balance between power and ease-of-use

### Visualization Quality
- Smooth, professional visualizations
- Avoid pixelated/rastered effects
- High-quality graphics suitable for publication

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize features based on user needs
2. Design user-friendly interfaces for each feature
3. Implement incrementally with user feedback
4. Maintain balance between functionality and usability

## Notes

These features represent a significant enhancement over basic VOACAP functionality.
The goal is to make HF propagation prediction accessible and useful for both
casual operators and serious DXers/professionals.
